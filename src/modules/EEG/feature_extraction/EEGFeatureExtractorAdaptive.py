class EEGFeatureExtractorAdaptive:
    """
    A novel approach to extracting EEG features, utilizing adaptive wavelet selection,
    dynamic filtering, and machine learning-based computation of excitation and valence.

    This class incorporates machine learning to predict excitation and valence based on
    EEG signal characteristics rather than relying on predefined formulas.

    Attributes:
        sampling_rate (float): EEG signal sampling rate in Hz.
        order (int): Order of the Butterworth filter.
